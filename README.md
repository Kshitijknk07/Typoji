# Typoji
Typoji changes words that have to do with feelings, like "happy," "skull," or "fire," into the right emoji as you type.  It can automatically replace words or ask for confirmation, which makes conversations more fun, expressive, and faster.  A simple tool that gives your text some personality without any extra work.
